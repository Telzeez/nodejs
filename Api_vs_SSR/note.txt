when using express you use it for two options
(1). using it to set up an API
(2). as a template with serving server side rendering

using route for a specific product
route parameters and query string
app.get('/api/products/:productId')
we then destructure the req object 
const {productId} = req.params //route parameters
const {search, limit} = req.query // for query string
console.log(typeof productId)  //string

middlewares in express
they are functions that execute during request to the server
i.e request => middleware => response
